BK solver
Heikki MÃ¤ntysaari <heikki.mantysaari@jyu.fi> 2011

Solves BK equation in momentum space.

== Output data structure ==
Files output_y[yval].dat contain calculated datapoints in the following format:
- Lines starting with (one) # are comments and should not be parsed
- First 3 lines are: minimum value of ktsqr, ktsqr multiplier, number of values in file
- These lines begin with "###"
- So that ktsqr[i] = minktsqr*pow(ktsqr_multiplier, i)
- Then in the rest of the file the syntax is
- ktsqr n(ktsqr, y)
e.g.
# Here we have solved BK!
###1e-08
###1.015
###2783
1e-08 10.0000001
etc

Rows must be sorted such that ktsqr grows when we move down in the file
