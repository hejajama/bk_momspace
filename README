BK solver
Heikki MÃ¤ntysaari <heikki.mantysaari@jyu.fi> 2011

Solves BK equation in momentum space.

== Output data structure ==
Files output_y[yval].dat contain calculated datapoints in the following format:
- Lines starting with (one) # are comments and should not be parsed
- First 4 lines are: rapidity, minimum value of ktsqr, ktsqr multiplier, number of values in file
- These lines begin with "###"
- So that ktsqr[i] = minktsqr*pow(ktsqr_multiplier, i)
- Then in the rest of the file the syntax is
- ktsqr n(ktsqr, y)
e.g.
# Here we have solved BK!
###1e-08
###1.015
###2783
###10.0
1e-08 10.0000001
etc

Rows must be sorted such that ktsqr grows when we move down in the file

All data can also be saved in one file output.dat, where syntax is
###min ktsqr
###ktsqr multiplier
###number of ktsqr values
###y rapidity
amplitude       
amplitud2       [here ktsqr=minktsqr*pow(ktsqr multiplier, i=1)
etc.
###y rapidity2
amplitude

and so on.

Matrix used in ChebyhsevAmplitudeSolver is saved in format
###dimension
###M
F_0,0
F_0,1
F_0,2
...
F_mn
...
F_(dimension+1),(dimension+1)
So there area (dimension+1)^2 lines after the ###dimension line

== Single datafiles ==
Datafiles generated in modes SINGLE_PLOT and LOGLOG_DERIVATIVE contain also
information about the saturation scale, formatted as:
### saturation_scale (NOT squared)
### saturation_scale defined as N(Q_s) = 0.05 (or something else, see main.cpp)
It is the first line starting with "###"
